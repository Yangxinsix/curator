Training machine learning potentials
=================================================
This tutorial will explain how to train models using CURATOR.

Preparing data
--------------
Training equivariant neural network potentials can be super easy with `curator` for new beginners. We defined every default hyperparameters except the `datapath`.
Therefore, the only thing you need to train a new model is the ab-initio dataset. CURATOR uses ASE's api for reading atomistic data, so any formats supported by ASE will work in `curator`.

For example, you can provide an `OUTCAR` file from VASP_ calculation or use ASE_ recommended `.traj` file as the training dataset.
A simple training task can be executed by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    curator-train data.datapath=water.traj


.. code-block:: bash

    curator-train cfg=user_cfg.yaml
